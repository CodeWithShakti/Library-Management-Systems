# Library-Management-Systems

Library Management System (LMS) - Frontend Project ðŸ“š
This is a dynamic, client-side Library Management System built exclusively using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It functions as a single-page application (SPA) demonstration, providing a clean and interactive interface for managing a library's catalog directly within the browser. This project is ideal for showcasing fundamental frontend development skills.

Key Features âœ¨
Pure Frontend Implementation: Built with zero backend dependencies. All logic, data storage, and rendering are handled by JavaScript.

Book Management: Users can add, edit, and delete book entries (Title, Author, ISBN) directly through the form interface.

Local Data Storage: Utilizes the browser's Local Storage to persist the library catalog data, so books remain listed even after the browser is closed and reopened.

Interactive Search: Real-time filtering and searching of the book catalog using JavaScript.

Clean, Responsive Design: Styled with CSS, ensuring the application is visually appealing and functional on various screen sizes.

Status Tracking: Ability to mark books as 'Read' or 'Unread'.
